# DS1Tracker
Note: some of the code has been mangled to make hosting it easier so the instructions below don't fully work.

Site to publically track the position of DS1

Run `npm install` to install the required modules.

Then, add an n2yo.com API key in `server.js` to allow for fetching the TLE (getting a key is super easy).

Once that's done, you can run `npm run dev` to start a basic dev server and view the page.

ToDo: 
* Potentially clean up map so it looks nicer
* Maaybe switch to React or something so that the structure of things makes more sense. Probably not worth it.
